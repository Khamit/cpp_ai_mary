### 🧠 Overview

A revolutionary C++ simulation framework that implements self-evolving neural field dynamics with real-time code optimization and adaptive learning capabilities. This system represents a significant breakthrough in computational neuroscience by introducing autonomous code evolution based on performance metrics.

### 🎯 What's New in v2.0 - "Evolving Intelligence"
Revolutionary Self-Evolution Capabilities
The system now features autonomous code evolution that optimizes itself based on three key performance metrics:

- Code Efficiency Score: Evaluates code size and complexity

- Performance Score: Measures computational efficiency and speed

- Energy Score: Tracks energy consumption and optimization

### EvolutionModule - The Brain Behind the Evolution
Real-time Fitness Evaluation: Continuously assesses system performance
Adaptive Mutation System: Proposes and applies intelligent code modifications
Automated Backups: Creates versioned backups before each evolution cycle
Stasis Management: Enters low-power mode during resource constraints

### ResourceMonitor - Intelligent Resource Management
Adaptive Thresholds: Self-adjusting CPU (85%) and memory (90%) limits
Debounce Protection: Prevents false overload triggers
Performance Scaling: Dynamically adjusts computational intensity

### ImmutableCore - Secure Evolution Foundation
Permission System: Controls mutation and optimization requests
Safety Protocols: Ensures stable evolution cycles
Rollback Mechanisms: Automatic recovery from failed optimizations
